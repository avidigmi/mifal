# Workflow map

Ask Matt body: sha256:f2af6326c5864784b16c41520e290f1455679bc1d6716f8373163da7d80aba4c

A hand-written table of the shipped skills: where each one runs, who invokes it, by what path, what it needs and what evidence shows it ran. It is not a router. Ask Matt (`skills/ask-matt/SKILL.md`) stays the only branch map, no row here decides a branch, and none of Matt's text is copied. `validate_contracts.py` reads this file at every Matt gate.

## Keeping it true

The `Ask Matt body:` line pins the Ask Matt body this map was reviewed against. When the installed body differs, every Matt gate holds with a message naming this map. To clear it, read the new Ask Matt body, fix the rows that no longer match, then replace the digest with the one that `validate_contracts.py read ~/.agents/skills/ask-matt/SKILL.md` prints in its footer.

The same check refuses a map that omits a shipped skill, lists one that is not shipped, or places a skill the wrong way:

- **Ask Matt rows** hold only skills that the installed Ask Matt body names as `/skill`. The Anchor says where Ask Matt places the skill.
- **Local attachments** attach to an Ask Matt row by name. They add a specialist at a phase, never a branch.
- **Factory section** holds what Ask Matt does not name: the factory core, and the starts Ask Matt does not cover.

It also refuses a map with a repeated authoritative section, or with more tables than its four. Both are read the way GitHub-flavored Markdown reads them: a heading is ATX (up to 3 spaces of indent, an optional closing `#` run) or setext (`===` or `---` underline), matched without regard to case or level; a table is any delimiter row outside a fence, with or without outer pipes, one or more hyphens per cell and up to 3 spaces of indent. Headings and tables written as raw HTML, or nested in a blockquote or a list item, are not recognised. The check covers structure, coverage, category and body freshness. It does not show that a row's prose matches Ask Matt or describes what the skill does; a reviewer reads the rows against the installed body.

Columns: Route and phase also decides which step's start Check a body's read is held against (the steps are in the phase record, 'Only the human cuts; reads come before the work'). Route and phase uses the route words of the engineering-workflow route table (research, plan, build, debug, review), plus `all` and `standalone`. Invoker is the lead (a solo agent counts as the lead) or a worker by brief. Evidence is what a gate or a reviewer can check; a `Loaded:` line records a read declaration and a hash, never that the skill was retrieved completely or applied. Anything not listed here is not shipped; the steward inventory discovers it from the user's own library.

| wayfinder | plan: scope and resolve (a foggy effort too big for one session) | lead | Skill tool (lead) | grilling, domain-modeling, research, prototype | the shared map of decision tickets on the tracker; it hands off at to-spec | ask-matt: On-ramps |

## Factory section

Starts and parts that Ask Matt does not name. Nothing here claims an Ask Matt branch.

### Factory core

| Skill | Route and phase | Invoker | Invocation path | Dependencies | Evidence | Anchor |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| engineering-workflow | all: every phase (the ordered route table and the gates) | lead; every worker by brief | the per-harness entry pointer; brief `Procedure:` line | ask-matt, team-lead, code-review, ddd, ddd-scope, ddd-ground, ddd-verify | `Procedure:` and `Loaded:` lines in every Matt record; the Phase checklist; the `workflow` gate runs | factory: the common execution contract |
| team-lead | all: coordination (assign, dispatch, accept) | lead | Skill tool (lead); `Implement: n/a: coordination:` requires its `Loaded:` line | herdr-adapter, validate-contracts, and the herdr skill when Herdr is the channel | the `Implement:` line; `Loaded:` line; one brief and one receipt per task | factory: team coordination |
| herdr-adapter | all: dispatch, resume and acceptance of Matt tasks | lead | the `tools/herdr_adapter` command line; its task JSON carries the Workflow keys into the brief | validate-contracts | its journal and task state, the doorbell lines and a receipt per attempt | factory: team coordination |
| validate-contracts | all: the entry, review and accept gates, and the brief and receipt checks | lead and worker | `python3 ~/.agents/skills/team-lead/scripts/validate_contracts.py` with brief, receipt or workflow; the adapter loads it as a module | no dependencies | the exit code and stderr of each run, recorded as `Check:` lines | factory: the gates |
| setup-pre-commit | build: implement (a one-off repository setup, on explicit request) | lead | Skill tool (lead), on request | no dependencies | the hook files in the repository and a passing commit-time run | factory: a Matt skill that Ask Matt does not place |

### Starts Ask Matt does not cover

| Start | Route and phase | Invoker | Invocation path | Dependencies | Evidence | Anchor |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| operational or one-off task | build: scope through report (the Build row of the route table, unchanged) | lead | engineering-workflow Required entry records Route build; no Ask Matt branch is claimed | engineering-workflow, code-review, retro, and wizard for steps only a human can take | the Workflow record with Route build and the Build row's phase evidence; reserved actions wait for the human's quoted grant | factory: Ask Matt has no start for an agent-doable operational task |
| team coordination | all: coordination (assign, dispatch, accept) | lead | team-lead, with the herdr-adapter or plain briefs | team-lead, herdr-adapter, validate-contracts | the `Implement: n/a: coordination:` line; one brief and one receipt per task; the parent `workflow` gate runs | factory: Ask Matt covers building, not running workers |

## Required steps

The steps each route, and for build each recorded Ask Matt branch, requires, in order. A step is a checklist item whose label, or whose words before the first colon, are the step's name (case, punctuation and a leading "to" do not matter: `- [x] To-spec: done` counts; `- [x] To-spec skipped` does not). The gates read this section: a step before one that is already done, or before the review or accept gate, must show as done on the Phase checklist, or a `Cut:` line must quote the human who cut it. A step still ahead of the record is pending, never a skip. The branch is the record's `Route decision`; it is read from the parent `State:` when the record has none. This restates the route table of engineering-workflow and Ask Matt's main flow; it decides no branch, and Ask Matt stays the only branch map.
